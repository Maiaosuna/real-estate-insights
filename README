Residential Properties SQL Analysis
This project uses SQL to analyze residential property data — including sale prices, building characteristics, and location-based trends — to uncover insights about different property types such as Lake Front and Canal Front homes.

Objective
The goal of this analysis is to: 
Compare sales and property characteristics across housing types
Analyze trends by location, year, and property type
Understand how factors like square footage, bedrooms, and location affect sales prices
Demonstrate SQL proficiency in cleaning, joining, and summarizing relational data

Tools & Technologies
SQL
CSV data files
Excel for quick validation

Output File Descriptions
property_type_sales_summary.csv
Top 10 property types by number of sales, grouped and labeled using codes.

property_type_size_summary.csv
Summary of total square footage and air-conditioned area by property type.

lake_vs_canal_bed_bath_comparison.csv
Comparison of bedroom and bathroom averages/mins/maxes for Lake vs Canal Front properties.

property_age_summary.csv
Average, oldest, and newest build dates for Lake and Canal Front properties as of 2023.

property_price_summary.csv
Min, max, and average most recent sale prices by property type.

yearly_price_trends_lake_vs_canal.csv
Price trends between 2013–2018 broken down by year and property type.

price_summary_by_year_city_zip.csv
Sale price trends over time by city and zip code for Lake and Canal Front properties.

lake_vs_canal_popularity_by_city.csv
Sales volume comparison for Lake vs Canal Front properties across years and cities.


 How to Recreate
Open ResidentialCode.sql in VSCode (or any SQLite-compatible environment)
Ensure all CSVs are stored in the /data/ folder and match file paths
Run each section (Parts B–K) to:
Create tables
Import data
Execute summary queries
Export CSVs using .mode csv + .output commands

Key Takeaways
Lake Front properties had slightly higher variability in pricing across regions.
Canal Front homes tend to be newer but with fewer sales in premium zip codes.
Zip code and city play a significant role in determining high-value sale clusters.

Potential Future Work
Visualize trends using Python (Pandas + Matplotlib) or Tableau
Predict sale prices with regression using property characteristics
Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit or Power BI)
